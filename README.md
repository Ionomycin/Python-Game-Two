# Python Game Two
[Intermediate] Random Number Generator Game (With a Twist)

1. Install IDLE First Before Doing This. MAKE SURE IT'S IDLE. It's free. I use the Python 3.8.1 Shell. Below is the link to it.
2. https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/
3. Scroll all the way down on the above link and you'll find the downloadable packages. Choose the one SPECIFIC TO YOUR OS.
4. Once installed, you can download the .py file I have programmed.
5. Use file > open > (find my .py file) to load my program into IDLE. Alternatively, you should be able to double-click my file on your desktop and it should open in IDLE without a problem, but if it does, use the first way I mentioned.
6. To run the program, click "Run > Run Module" in the top navigation bar. It may have you save the document. If this happens, click "Save" and it should automatically execute my program.
7. That's all there is to it! This will be how you run ALL of my programs. Any additional materials will ALWAYS be provided and I will explain how to use them step by step.

Enjoy,

The program I have coded, will take user input and compare it to that of the RNG module in IDLE (Python) and do some more intricate operations than the first program I created. See comments inside of the program for more information.

I haven't added exception catching to this program yet so it only accepts INTEGER VALUES. You WILL recieve errors for inputting floating-point (e.g., 0.5) values and strings (e.g. "string").

**Things you can change:**
Nothing currently. You can definetely experiment around with it if you wish it's rather a simplistic program. I will update this section once I have implemented some better features and make it easier for users to alter information inside the program.
